This repository contains the source code of the 4th assignment of the **"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence"** course held at NTNU during the Fall 2023 semester.

Starting from the pseudocode given in Russel and Norwig's textbook _Artificial Intelligence, A Modern Approach_, we implemented the **Minimax** algorithm (both standard version and with **Alpha-Beta pruning**), and used it in the _Pac-Man Projects_ developed at UC Berkeley.

The detailed report can be found [here](https://github.com/FrancescaGrimaldi/intro-to-ai-assignments/blob/main/assignment%204/assignment_4.pdf).
